<h2>Description</h2>
<p> Spaghetti alla carbonara. Luscious and wonderfully indulgent, pasta carbonara takes as long to make as it does to cook the pasta.

    The ingredients are simpleâ€”just spaghetti (or another long pasta), and the carbonara is made with pancetta or bacon, eggs, Parmesan, a little olive oil, salt and pepper.
    
    The silky carbonara sauce is created when the beaten eggs are tossed with the hot pasta and a little fat from the pancetta or bacon.
    
    Did I already mention indulgent? Yes, this is not a make-it-everyday recipe. This is an I've-been-eating-my-kale-for-weeks-and-now-I-want-to-splurge recipe.
    
    But heck, if you are going to splurge, you may as well do it right with pasta carbonara. </p>
